# Jade - JavaScript IDE in Emacs

Jade connects to a browser tab and provides the following JavaScript development features:

- REPL (with auto completion)
- Inspector
- Stepping Debugger

## Missing features

Jade is young, here's a list of missing/wanted features

- Code evaluation using `C-M-x`
- Adding breakpoints (to remove the need for `debugger` statements)
- Network inspector (could get inspiration from restclient.el)
- DOM inspector

There is currently support for Chrom[e|ium], Firefox & NodeJS backends are not
yet implemented.
