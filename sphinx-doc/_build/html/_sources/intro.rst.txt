Jade is a JavaScript development environment for `Emacs <http://gnu.org/software/emacs>`_.

Jade connects to a browser tab or nodejs process and provides several features
for JavaScript development, including:

* a REPL (with auto completion) & object inspection;
* an inspector, with history and navigation;
* a scratch buffer (``M-x jade-scratch``);
* JavaScript evaluation in JS buffers with ``jade-interaction-mode``;
* a stepping Debugger, similar to ``edebug``, or ``cider``.
